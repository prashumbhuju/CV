    <p>I am a Technology Enthusiast and have recently completed my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology. I have always had a stirring affection for Information communication and technology and desired to make this field my profession. I would define myself as an extrovert and self-motivated person with excellent team player attributes. I am keen to learn new concepts and ideas, enabling me to analyse problems and provide innovative solutions.
        I have profound knowledge about IT and Business Analyst and have utilised them more often in my prior experiences. I have worked as IT Technician and IT Support in my previous workplace and am keen to have a similar experience here in Australia.
        I am looking for opportunities to utilise my interpersonal and professional skills and polish the knowledge I acquire.</p>
